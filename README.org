#+TITLE: SimpleShop: Backend Library for a tiny online shop

~SimpleShop~ is a small library implementing the backend for a hypothetical shop.
This is a toy project to refresh my SQL and therefore obviously missing features required for a real shop.

The script ~create_database.py~ will create an SQLite database named ~database.db~ with the required format.
~api.py~ defines functions to add new customers and products to the database, as well as to search for customers (based e.g. on name) and to record new orders.

Running ~api.py~ will insert a few customers and products into the database as well as place an order.

Documentation is inside the source code.

* Requirements
  Python 3.
  This program only uses the standard library, thus has no other dependencies.
  It was developed using Python 3.12.2, though it should also run under older versions.
